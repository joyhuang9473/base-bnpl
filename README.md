# Base-BNPL: Buy Now, Pay Later on Base

A decentralized Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) protocol built on Base, enabling users to make purchases with installment payments while maintaining full control of their collateral.

## üöÄ Overview

Base-BNPL is a comprehensive DeFi lending protocol that combines traditional BNPL functionality with blockchain technology. Users can purchase goods and services from merchants using installment payments, with their crypto assets serving as collateral. The protocol features automated risk assessment, collateral management, and yield generation for lenders.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Zero-Interest Installments**: Most payment plans feature 0% interest for standard terms
- **Crypto Collateral**: Use any supported ERC-20 token as collateral
- **Automated Risk Assessment**: On-chain credit scoring based on wallet history and collateral
- **Liquidity Pool**: Earn yield by providing USDC to the lending pool
- **Merchant Integration**: Seamless merchant onboarding and settlement
- **Collateral Management**: Automated liquidation and recovery systems
- **Risk-Based Pricing**: Dynamic APY based on borrower risk tiers

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The protocol consists of four main smart contracts working together:

### 1. **CollateralManager** (`CollateralManager.sol`)
- Manages collateral locking, valuation, and liquidation
- Supports multiple ERC-20 tokens as collateral
- Automated price feeds and liquidation thresholds
- Emergency withdrawal capabilities for admins

### 2. **LendingPool** (`LendingPool.sol`)
- Manages lender deposits and yield distribution
- Risk-tiered APY system (4% - 15% APY)
- Reserve fund for loss protection
- Utilization-based lending limits

### 3. **PaymentController** (`PaymentController.sol`)
- Handles loan creation and payment processing
- Automated payment scheduling and late fee calculation
- Merchant settlement and order management
- Default detection and liquidation triggers

### 4. **RiskEngine** (`RiskEngine.sol`)
- On-chain credit assessment and scoring (300-850 scale)
- Risk tier classification (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, DENIED)
- Payment history tracking and score adjustments
- Collateral ratio validation
